## React SSR Practice Project
This project serves as a practical exploration of server-side rendering (SSR) in React applications. It replicates an existing React app on the client-side and sets up a server with Express for SSR. Implemented features include Express and Webpack configuration, React Router DOM usage, hydration, HTML template creation, server-side style handling, API fetching and Hot Module Replacement. Ideal for learning SSR techniques and tool setups in React.
